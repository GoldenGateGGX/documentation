To run transactions on one of the Golden Gate networks, one needs tokens of the respective network (test tokens for a testnet and GGX tokens for the mainnet). To manage tokens, a wallet is required. A cryptocurrency wallet, often referred to as a crypto wallet or digital wallet, is a software program or hardware device that allows individuals to securely store, manage, and interact with their cryptocurrencies. It provides a means for users to store their cryptographic keys, which are required to access and control their digital assets on a blockchain.
Golden Gate utilizes a hybrid virtual machine. Transactions can be executed in EVM or [WASM] environments. You can use different wallets/account managers to operate in different environments. [Metamask] is the most common way to operate with EVM tokens.
[Polkadot.JS] is the native way to operate with substrate-based VM tokens.
