is Golden Gate?\nGolden Gate is the Interchain Infrastructure Protocol that utilizes Multi-Party Computation for interoperable communication and advanced liquidity routing over a network of decentralized independent sub-chains.\nGolden Gate is built to connect arbitrary chains with each other turning sharded environment into the internet of blockchains.\nWhy Golden Gate?\nGolden Gate is a single platform where you can access most of available blockchain (aiming to provide availability for all valueable chains). Golden Gate utilizes hybrid virtual machine so you can programm in solidity as well as any general purpose programming language that can be compiled into the WASM (e.g. Rust, Javascript)\nWe provide agnostic base layer communication. modern security techniques and zero-knowledge precompiles providing the richest environment for dapps development, especially for dapps that require cross-chain communication\n"},"terms-and-definitions.html":{"url":"terms-and-definitions.html","title":"Terms and Definitions","keywords":"","body":"Terms and Definitions\nAURA\nThe Authority Round (AURA) block production algorithm is a consensus mechanism designed explicitly for permissioned or consortium blockchains. In the AURA algorithm, a designated set of authorities or validators take turns producing blocks in a round-robin fashion. The authorities are typically trusted participants within the network, such as known organizations or entities.\nBABE\nBABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension) is a block production algorithm used in GGX. BABE is designed to be fast, efficient, and secure, and it uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to achieve consensus among nodes in the network.\nBlock\nA block in a blockchain is a collection of data that is bundled together with a unique digital signature, known as a cryptographic hash. The data contained in a block can vary depending on the specific blockchain application, but it typically includes a record of recent transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block in the chain.\nBlock explorer\nA block explorer is a tool that allows users to view and analyze the contents of a blockchain, including the transaction history, current status, and other important data. Block explorers are web-based applications that provide an intuitive user interface for navigating the blockchain, as well as a wide range of features for exploring and analyzing its data.\nBLS signatures\nBLS signatures are specific signatures widely used in blockchains. They offer advantages over traditional signature schemes, such as shorter signature sizes, faster verification times, and aggregation of signatures.\nByzantine Fault Tolerance\nByzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is a characteristic of a distributed system that enables it to remain operational and consistent even in the presence of faulty components or malicious actors. The term \"Byzantine\" refers to the \"Byzantine Generals' Problem\", a hypothetical scenario in which a group of generals with different goals must coordinate a plan of attack while being separated by long distances and unreliable communication channels.\nConsensus\nConsensus is the process of a group of entities to agree on a particular data value (such as the ordering and makeup of blocks on a blockchain). There are a variety of algorithms used for determining consensus. GGX uses hybrid consensus - AURA for block production and GRANDPA as a finality gadget.\nController Account\nIn Golden Gate, a controller account is a type of account that is used to control the staking and nomination activities of a stash account. A stash account is a primary account that holds a user's GGX tokens and is used for staking and nominating, while the controller account is a separate account that is linked to the stash account to manage its staking and nomination activities.\nDapps\nDApps (decentralized applications) are applications that run on a decentralized network, such as a blockchain. They are generally designed to be open-source, transparent, and resistant to censorship, making them a promising development in the field of blockchain technology.\nExtrinsic\nIn programming, extrinsic refers to a property or characteristic of a function or method that depends on external factors, such as its input parameters or its environment.\nExtrinsic properties can affect the behavior of a function or method, but they are not inherent to the function itself. For example, the output of a function may depend on a variable or value that is passed in as an argument, which is an extrinsic property.\nFinality\nIn a blockchain, finality refers to the irreversible confirmation of a transaction or block. Once a transaction or block has been confirmed as final, it is considered permanently added to the blockchain and cannot be reversed or altered.\nFinality Gadget\nA mechanism that determines finality.\nGRANDPA\nGRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement) is a finality gadget used in the GGX network to achieve fast and secure finality. It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm that works in conjunction with the BABE block production algorithm to provide finality for GGX Network.\nGovernance\nThe process of determining what changes to the network are permissible, such as modifications to code or movement of funds. The governance system in Polkadot is on-chain and revolves around stakeholder voting, i.e., the majority of the stake (DOTs) determines the direction of the network.\nLIBP2P\nAn open-source library for encrypted peer-to-peer communications and other networking functionality. More information at: https://libp2p.io/\nLiveness\nThe property of a distributed system is that it will eventually come to some sort of consensus. A system stuck in an infinite loop would not be considered live, even if computations are taking place; a system that eventually provides a result, even if incorrect or it takes a long time, is considered to have liveness.\nNode Explorer\nA tool that gives you information about a node, such as the latest blocks sealed, finalized, and the current chain state as known by that node.\nNominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)\nA proof of stake system whereby nominators \"lend\" their stake to validators as a show of faith in the good behavior of the validator. Nominated proof-of-stake differs from delegated proof-of-stake in that nominators are subject to loss of stake if they nominate a bad validator; delegates are not subject to loss of stake based on the behavior of the validator.\nNominator\nNodes that select a set of validators. A certain amount of DOTs must be staked in order to do so, which may be lost if the validator behaves badly. This forces nominators to carefully select validators.\nNTP\nNetworking protocol designed to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network. NTP(Network Time Protocol) allows you to synchronize the clocks of all the systems within the network. Currently it is required that validators' local clocks stay reasonably in sync, so you should be running NTP or a similar service\nOn-chain Governance\nGovernance of a blockchain which is controlled by mechanisms controlled by the blockchain. On-chain governance allows for decisions can be made transparently. Note that there are a variety of different algorithms for making these decisions, such as simple majority voting or identity-based quadratic voting.\nProof of Stake (PoS)\nA method of achieving consensus in which the next block is determined by a node that is chosen by some characteristic (e.g., the amount of tokens that they stake).\nProof of Work\nA method of achieving consensus in which the next block is determined by the first to solve a difficult puzzle (e.g., in Bitcoin, solving a partial pre-image hash for a block candidate).\nRuntime\nA state transition function indicates a valid algorithm for determining the state of the next block given the previous block.\nRuntime Module\nWasm code which encodes a state transition function.\nSafety\nThe property of a distributed system indicates that the system will properly meet all invariants; that is, that nothing \"bad\" ever happens to the data (such as it being corrupted).\nSession Certificate\nAnother name for the session \"key\" which is a BLS key for GRANDPA, a sr25519 key for BABE, and eventually an Ed25519 key for libp2p.\nSession key\nA session \"key\" is a BLS key for GRANDPA, a sr25519 key for BABE, and eventually an Ed25519 key for libp2p.\nSolidity\nSolidity is a high-level programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum. It is one of the most widely used languages for developing decentralized applications (dApps) and executing smart contracts within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\nStaking\nIn Golden Gate, staking refers to locking up a certain amount of GGX tokens to participate in network consensus and governance. Staking is a key mechanism in the Golden Gate ecosystem, as it helps secure the network and enables token holders to vote in the decision-making process.\nStash Account\nIn Golden Gate, a stash account is a primary account that holds a user's GGX tokens and is used for staking and nominating on the network. When a user wants to participate in staking and nominating activities, they must first transfer their GGX tokens to their stash account.\nState Transition Function\nA function which describes how the state of a blockchain can be transformed. For example, it may describe how tokens can be transferred from one account to another.\nSubstrate\nSubstrate is an open-source modular framework for building custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). It is developed by Parity Technologies and is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use.\nSubstrate provides a set of pre-built modules that developers can use to create customized blockchain networks and dApps. These modules include functionality for consensus, networking, storage, governance, and more, allowing developers to quickly build and launch their own blockchain-based projects.\nTransaction\nAn individual element of the state transition function of a block, such as moving tokens from one account to another.\nValidator\nA node secures the relay chain by staking DOTs, validating proofs from collators on parachains, and determining a consensus along with other validators.\nVoting\nThe process of stakeholders determining whether or not a referendum to implement a specific proposal should pass. Votes are weighted both by the number of GGX tokens that the stakeholder account controls and the amount of time they are willing to lock their GGX tokens up.\nWallet\nA program that allows one to store, receive, and transmit GGX tokens or other blockchain-based tokens.\nWebAssembly\nAn instruction format for a virtual, stack-based machine. Polkadot Runtime Modules are compiled into WebAssembly. Also known as Wasm.\nWasm\nAn instruction format for a virtual, stack-based machine. Polkadot Runtime Modules are compiled to Wasm.\nWitness\nCryptographic proof statements of data validity.\n"},"architecture/":{"url":"architecture/","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\n"},"architecture/accounts-and-transactions.html":{"url":"architecture/accounts-and-transactions.html","title":"Accounts and transactions","keywords":"","body":"Accounts and transactions\nIn the context of blockchain, a transaction refers to a fundamental unit of activity that occurs on a blockchain network. It represents a transfer or exchange of data or value between participants in the network (accounts).\nIn Golden Gate, accounts are entities used to represent individuals or entities that own and transact with GGX tokens on the blockchain. Accounts are similar to bank accounts in traditional finance, where they hold assets and facilitate transactions. Each account in Golden Gate has a unique address, a string of characters that identifies the account on the blockchain. The address is derived from the account's public key, used to sign transactions and verify the account's ownership of tokens. Accounts in Golden Gate can be of two types: \nExternal accounts: These accounts are owned by individuals or entities and are not associated with any specific smart contract or on-chain identity. External accounts can hold tokens and can participate in transactions on the blockchain.\n\nContract accounts are associated with smart contracts on the blockchain and are used to store and manage contract states. Contract accounts can execute code and interact with other contracts and external accounts. Accounts in Golden Gate can be managed by users using their private keys. For example, users can sign transactions with their private keys to transfer tokens from their accounts or interact with smart contracts.\nAccounts can also be managed by on-chain governance mechanisms, such as council members or validators, who can execute transactions on behalf of the account.\n\n Overall, accounts are a fundamental concept in Substrate and are essential for managing token ownership and transactions on the blockchain.\n"},"architecture/virtual-machine.html":{"url":"architecture/virtual-machine.html","title":"Hybrid Virtual Machine","keywords":"","body":"Virtual Machine\nGolden Gate utilizes a hybrid virtual machine. Smart contracts in Golden Gate can be written in a general-purpose language that compiles into the WebAssembly or on Solidity.\nWhat is WebAssembly?\nWebAssembly, shortened to Wasm, is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.\nWhy WebAssembly?\nWebAssembly is a platform-agnostic binary format, meaning it will run the exact instructions across whatever machine it operates on. Blockchains need determinacy to have reliable state transition updates across all nodes in the peer-to-peer network without forcing every peer to run the same hardware. Wasm is an excellent fit for reliability among the diverse set of machines. Wasm is both efficient and fast. The efficiency means that it can be uploaded onto the chain as a blob of code without causing too much state bloat while keeping its ability to execute at near-native speeds.\nResources\n\nWebAssembly.org - WebAssembly homepage that contains a link to the spec.\nWasmi - WebAssembly interpreter written in Rust.\nParity Wasm - WebAssembly serialization/deserialization in Rust.\nWasm utils - Collection of Wasm utilities used in Parity and Wasm contract development.\n\n"},"architecture/consensus.html":{"url":"architecture/consensus.html","title":"Consensus","keywords":"","body":"Consensus\nWhy do we need Consensus?\nConsensus is an essential aspect of blockchain technology because it enables the system to reach an agreement on the state of the ledger or database without the need for a central authority. In a decentralized blockchain network, there are many nodes that maintain a copy of the database, and they need to agree on the current state of the ledger.\nConsensus is necessary to ensure that the blockchain network remains secure and immutable. If there is no consensus mechanism in place, it would be possible for an attacker to manipulate the ledger's state by introducing fraudulent transactions. With a consensus mechanism, all nodes must agree on the validity of a transaction before it can be added to the ledger, making it virtually impossible for an attacker to manipulate the system.\nConsensus also helps to prevent double-spending, which is a critical issue in decentralized payment systems. Without consensus, it would be possible for a user to spend the same digital asset more than once, leading to an inconsistent ledger state. By requiring consensus on the validity of transactions, the blockchain network ensures that double-spending is prevented.\nWhat are PoW and PoS?\nPoW and PoS are two popular consensus mechanisms used in blockchain technology.\nPoW, or Proof of Work, is a consensus mechanism that requires nodes in the network to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. Miners in a PoW blockchain network compete to solve these problems, and the first one to solve the puzzle earns a reward and adds a new block to the chain. PoW is used by popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it is known for being highly secure but energy-intensive.\nPoS, or Proof of Stake, is a consensus mechanism that selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. Validators put up a stake of their cryptocurrency as collateral, and they are selected to validate transactions and create new blocks based on the size of their stake. In a PoS blockchain network, validators are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network because they stand to lose their stake if they behave maliciously. PoS is known for being more energy-efficient than PoW because it doesn't require nodes to solve complex mathematical problems.\nBoth PoW and PoS have their advantages and disadvantages, and different blockchain networks may choose to implement one or the other depending on their specific requirements.\nNominated Proof of Stake\nNominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) is a variation of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that is designed to enhance the security and decentralization of a blockchain network.\nIn a traditional PoS system, the validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, and they are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. However, in some PoS systems, the concentration of power among a small number of validators can pose a security risk to the network, as these validators may collude to manipulate transactions or control the network.\nNPoS addresses this issue by allowing token holders to nominate validators on the network. This means that token holders can choose which validators they trust to validate transactions and secure the network, and they can vote to remove validators that are not acting in the network's best interest.\nIn an NPoS system, the validators are still selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, but they must also be nominated by a certain number of token holders to be eligible. Validators are then chosen based on their total stake and the number of nominations they receive. This ensures that the network is decentralized, and there is a fair distribution of power among the validators.\nProbabilistic vs. Provable Finality\nProbabilistic and provable finality are two different approaches to achieving finality in blockchain networks.\nProbabilistic finality is a concept used in consensus mechanisms that use probabilistic algorithms to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In a probabilistic system, there is a small chance that a transaction may be reversed or a block may be orphaned if there is a competing chain with more computational power. This is because the blockchain network may occasionally experience forks or temporary reorganizations, but these are quickly resolved as the network continues to add new blocks.\nIn contrast, provable finality is a concept used in consensus mechanisms that provide mathematical proof that a transaction is confirmed and cannot be reversed. In a provable system, once a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered final and cannot be modified or reversed. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures and hash functions, which ensure that any changes to a block would invalidate the cryptographic signatures of subsequent blocks.\nProvable finality is considered to be more secure and reliable than probabilistic finality because it provides a higher level of confidence that transactions are confirmed and cannot be reversed. However, provable finality may require more computational resources than probabilistic finality, and it may be more difficult to achieve in highly decentralized networks.\nUltimately, the choice between probabilistic and provable finality depends on the specific requirements of the blockchain network and the trade-offs between security, scalability, and efficiency.\nHybrid Consensus\nHybrid consensus with POS block production and the finality gadget is a consensus mechanism that combines Proof of Stake (PoS) for block production and the finality gadget for provable finality in a blockchain network.\nIn this mechanism, validators with a stake of cryptocurrency are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions on the network. Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network because they stand to lose their stake if they behave maliciously.\nThe finality gadget is then used to provide provable finality to the network. It works by using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithms to ensure that once a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered final and cannot be modified or reversed.\nThe combination of PoS block production and the finality gadget provides a secure and efficient consensus mechanism for blockchain networks. It is known for being energy-efficient compared to PoW-based systems and provides fast transaction finality, making it suitable for applications that require high throughput and low latency.\nBlock Production: AURA\nAURA (Authority Round) is a block production algorithm used in the Golden Gate network.\nIn the AURA algorithm, a designated set of authorities or validators take turns producing blocks in a round-robin fashion. The authorities are typically trusted participants within the network, such as known organizations or entities.\nThe block production process in AURA involves the following steps:\n\nSelection of Leader: At the beginning of each round, a leader or primary authority is selected. The selection process can be predetermined or based on a specific criterion, such as a rotating schedule or a voting mechanism.\nBlock Proposal: The selected leader creates a new block proposal containing transactions that are to be included in the next block. This block proposal may undergo a validation process by other authorities to ensure its integrity and adherence to predefined rules.\nBlock Verification: Once the block proposal is created, it is broadcasted to the other authorities in the network for verification. The other authorities validate the proposed block, ensuring it meets the consensus rules and does not conflict with the existing blockchain state.\nBlock Commitment: If the proposed block is approved by the majority or a predetermined threshold of the other authorities, it is considered valid and committed to the blockchain. The block is added to the blockchain, and the leader's turn is completed.\nRound Progression: After the block commitment, the round proceeds to the next authority in the predefined order, and the process repeats. Each authority takes turns being the leader, proposing blocks, and receiving verification from the other authorities.\n\nThe AURA algorithm leverages the trust and reputation of the designated authorities to facilitate block production and maintain consensus within the network.\nFinality Gadget: GRANDPA\nThe GRANDPA finality gadget is used to provide provable finality to the blocks in the Polkadot chain. It works by using a GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) algorithm to determine the final consensus of the network. The GHOST algorithm takes into account the weight of the blocks in the chain to determine which blocks are the heaviest and have the most support from the network.\nOnce the GHOST algorithm has determined the heaviest chain, GRANDPA uses a recursive process to derive a prefix of this chain that has the support of the majority of the network. This prefix is then considered final and cannot be modified or reversed.\nThe GRANDPA finality gadget is designed to be efficient and scalable, making it suitable for high-throughput applications. Its use of a recursive process allows it to quickly determine the final consensus of the network, and its use of a prefix ensures that only a small portion of the blockchain needs to be finalized, reducing the time and resources required for finality.\nOverall, the GRANDPA finality gadget is an important component of the Golden Gate network's consensus mechanism, ensuring fast and secure transactions across multiple chains.\nResources\n\nGRANDPA paper - The academic description of the GRANDPA finality gadget.
