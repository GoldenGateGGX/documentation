PolkadotJS Account Manager is a JavaScript library and toolset specifically designed for managing accounts and interacting with Substrate-based blockchains. The PolkadotJS Account Manager provides a user-friendly interface for creating, importing, and managing accounts. It abstracts away the complexity of cryptographic key management and provides a simplified API for developers to work with accounts.

Key features of the PolkadotJS Account Manager include:

Account Creation: It allows users to generate new accounts with corresponding public and private keys. These accounts can be used to interact with Substrate-based blockchains.

**Account Import**: It enables users to import existing accounts by providing their private keys or mnemonic phrases.

**Account Management**: The library provides functionality for managing multiple accounts, including listing, deleting, and switching between accounts.

**Signing Transactions**: It allows users to sign transactions using the private keys associated with their accounts. This is a critical step for interacting with the blockchain, as signed transactions are necessary for ensuring authenticity and integrity. PolkadotJS account manager is recommended to operate within the Golden Gate networks as it ensures smooth integration with the Golden Gate web UI.
