and Transactions","keywords":"","body":"Accounts and transactions\nIn the context of blockchain, a transaction refers to a fundamental unit of activity that occurs on a blockchain network. It represents a transfer or exchange of data or value between participants in the network (accounts).\nIn Golden Gate, accounts are entities used to represent individuals or entities that own and transact with GGX tokens on the blockchain. Accounts are similar to bank accounts in traditional finance, where they hold assets and facilitate transactions. Each account in Golden Gate has a unique address, a string of characters that identifies the account on the blockchain. The address is derived from the account's public key, used to sign transactions and verify the account's ownership of tokens. Accounts in Golden Gate can be of two types:\nExternal accounts: These accounts are owned by individuals or entities and are not associated with any specific smart contract or on-chain identity. External accounts can hold tokens and can participate in transactions on the blockchain.\n\nContract accounts are associated with smart contracts on the blockchain and are used to store and manage contract states. Contract accounts can execute code and interact with other contracts and external accounts. Accounts in Golden Gate can be managed by users using their private keys. For example, users can sign transactions with their private keys to transfer tokens from their accounts or interact with smart contracts.\nAccounts can also be managed by on-chain governance mechanisms, such as council members or validators, who can execute transactions on behalf of the account.\n\nOverall, accounts are a fundamental concept in Substrate and are essential for managing token ownership and transactions on the blockchain.\n"},"developer-documentation/architecture/consensus.html":{"url":"developer-documentation/architecture/consensus.html","title":"Consensus","keywords":"","body":"Consensus\nWhy do we need Consensus?\nConsensus is an essential aspect of blockchain technology because it enables the system to reach an agreement on the state of the ledger or database without the need for a central authority. In a decentralized blockchain network, there are many nodes that maintain a copy of the database, and they need to agree on the current state of the ledger.\nConsensus is necessary to ensure that the blockchain network remains secure and immutable. If there is no consensus mechanism in place, it would be possible for an attacker to manipulate the ledger's state by introducing fraudulent transactions. With a consensus mechanism, all nodes must agree on the validity of a transaction before it can be added to the ledger, making it virtually impossible for an attacker to manipulate the system.\nConsensus also helps to prevent double-spending, which is a critical issue in decentralized payment systems. Without consensus, it would be possible for a user to spend the same digital asset more than once, leading to an inconsistent ledger state. By requiring consensus on the validity of transactions, the blockchain network ensures that double-spending is prevented.\nWhat are PoW and PoS?\nPoW and PoS are two popular consensus mechanisms used in blockchain technology.\nPoW, or Proof of Work, is a consensus mechanism that requires nodes in the network to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. Miners in a PoW blockchain network compete to solve these problems, and the first one to solve the puzzle earns a reward and adds a new block to the chain. PoW is used by popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it is known for being highly secure but energy-intensive.\nPoS, or Proof of Stake, is a consensus mechanism that selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. Validators put up a stake of their cryptocurrency as collateral, and they are selected to validate transactions and create new blocks based on the size of their stake. In a PoS blockchain network, validators are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network because they stand to lose their stake if they behave maliciously. PoS is known for being more energy-efficient than PoW because it doesn't require nodes to solve complex mathematical problems.\nBoth PoW and PoS have their advantages and disadvantages, and different blockchain networks may choose to implement one or the other depending on their specific requirements.\nNominated Proof of Stake\nNominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) is a variation of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that is designed to enhance the security and decentralization of a blockchain network.\nIn a traditional PoS system, the validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, and they are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. However, in some PoS systems, the concentration of power among a small number of validators can pose a security risk to the network, as these validators may collude to manipulate transactions or control the network.\nNPoS addresses this issue by allowing token holders to nominate validators on the network. This means that token holders can choose which validators they trust to validate transactions and secure the network, and they can vote to remove validators that are not acting in the network's best interest.\nIn an NPoS system, the validators are still selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, but they must also be nominated by a certain number of token holders to be eligible. Validators are then chosen based on their total stake and the number of nominations they receive. This ensures that the network is decentralized, and there is a fair distribution of power among the validators.\nProbabilistic vs. Provable Finality\nProbabilistic and provable finality are two different approaches to achieving finality in blockchain networks.\nProbabilistic finality is a concept used in consensus mechanisms that use probabilistic algorithms to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In a probabilistic system, there is a small chance that a transaction may be reversed or a block may be orphaned if there is a competing chain with more computational power. This is because the blockchain network may occasionally experience forks or temporary reorganizations, but these are quickly resolved as the network continues to add new blocks.\nIn contrast, provable finality is a concept used in consensus mechanisms that provide mathematical proof that a transaction is confirmed and cannot be reversed. In a provable system, once a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered final and cannot be modified or reversed. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures and hash functions, which ensure that any changes to a block would invalidate the cryptographic signatures of subsequent blocks.\nProvable finality is considered to be more secure and reliable than probabilistic finality because it provides a higher level of confidence that transactions are confirmed and cannot be reversed. However, provable finality may require more computational resources than probabilistic finality, and it may be more difficult to achieve in highly decentralized networks.\nUltimately, the choice between probabilistic and provable finality depends on the specific requirements of the blockchain network and the trade-offs between security, scalability, and efficiency.\nHybrid Consensus\nHybrid consensus with POS block production and the finality gadget is a consensus mechanism that combines Proof of Stake (PoS) for block production and the finality gadget for provable finality in a blockchain network.\nIn this mechanism, validators with a stake of cryptocurrency are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions on the network. Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network because they stand to lose their stake if they behave maliciously.\nThe finality gadget is then used to provide provable finality to the network. It works by using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithms to ensure that once a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered final and cannot be modified or reversed.\nThe combination of PoS block production and the finality gadget provides a secure and efficient consensus mechanism for blockchain networks. It is known for being energy-efficient compared to PoW-based systems and provides fast transaction finality, making it suitable for applications that require high throughput and low latency.\nBlock Production: AURA\nAURA (Authority Round) is a block production algorithm used in the Golden Gate network.\nIn the AURA algorithm, a designated set of authorities or validators take turns producing blocks in a round-robin fashion. The authorities are typically trusted participants within the network, such as known organizations or entities.\nThe block production process in AURA involves the following steps:\n\nSelection of Leader: At the beginning of each round, a leader or primary authority is selected. The selection process can be predetermined or based on a specific criterion, such as a rotating schedule or a voting mechanism.\nBlock Proposal: The selected leader creates a new block proposal containing transactions that are to be included in the next block. This block proposal may undergo a validation process by other authorities to ensure its integrity and adherence to predefined rules.\nBlock Verification: Once the block proposal is created, it is broadcasted to the other authorities in the network for verification. The other authorities validate the proposed block, ensuring it meets the consensus rules and does not conflict with the existing blockchain state.\nBlock Commitment: If the proposed block is approved by the majority or a predetermined threshold of the other authorities, it is considered valid and committed to the blockchain. The block is added to the blockchain, and the leader's turn is completed.\nRound Progression: After the block commitment, the round proceeds to the next authority in the predefined order, and the process repeats. Each authority takes turns being the leader, proposing blocks, and receiving verification from the other authorities.\n\nThe AURA algorithm leverages the trust and reputation of the designated authorities to facilitate block production and maintain consensus within the network.\nFinality Gadget: GRANDPA\nThe GRANDPA finality gadget is used to provide provable finality to the blocks in the Polkadot chain. It works by using a GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) algorithm to determine the final consensus of the network. The GHOST algorithm takes into account the weight of the blocks in the chain to determine which blocks are the heaviest and have the most support from the network.\nOnce the GHOST algorithm has determined the heaviest chain, GRANDPA uses a recursive process to derive a prefix of this chain that has the support of the majority of the network. This prefix is then considered final and cannot be modified or reversed.\nThe GRANDPA finality gadget is designed to be efficient and scalable, making it suitable for high-throughput applications. Its use of a recursive process allows it to quickly determine the final consensus of the network, and its use of a prefix ensures that only a small portion of the blockchain needs to be finalized, reducing the time and resources required for finality.\nOverall, the GRANDPA finality gadget is an important component of the Golden Gate network's consensus mechanism, ensuring fast and secure transactions across multiple chains.\nResources\n\nGRANDPA paper - The academic description of the GRANDPA finality gadget.

Sydney testnet is a Proof-of-Stake network based on the Golden Gate blockchain.\nGolden Gate team holds privileged access to the network having the authority to upgrade and configure the network solely. We configured it this way to ensure failover in case of any emergency. We plan to revoke this access after the network gains enough maturity. Any usage of privileged access by the Golden Gate team will be transparent and evident to other network participants. Golden Gate team is not incentivized to use privileged access unless in an emergency.\nSydney testnet includes democracy routines. Any validator can propose a network upgrade or tokenomics parameter changes. The proposal will be the subject of voting by all Validators that have the minimum amount of tokens staked (1000 GGXT). The proposal is accepted/rejected by a simple majority rule.\nValidator incentives \n\nRewards - Validators in the Sydney network have the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of GGXT tokens. By staking and participating in the consensus mechanism, validators can receive regular rewards for their contribution to securing and maintaining the network. [tokenomics parameters here]\nGovernance and Influence - Validators play a vital role in the decentralized governance of the Sydney network. They have the power to vote on proposals and influence the direction of the network's development and upgrades. Participating as a validator allows individuals and organizations to have a say in the decision-making process and contribute to shaping the future of the network.\nCommunity and Collaboration - Participating as a validator provides an opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals and collaborate on projects and initiatives related to the Sydney network. It allows for knowledge sharing, networking, and building relationships with others in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.\nLearning and Technical Experience - Operating a validator node in the Sydney network requires technical knowledge and infrastructure setup. Participating as a validator can be a learning experience, allowing individuals and organizations to deepen their understanding of blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms, and network operations.\nSupporting the Network: Validators play a crucial role in the security and integrity of the Sydney network. By participating as a validator, individuals and organizations contribute to the network's overall health and resilience. Validators help ensure the network is secure, transactions are validated, and consensus is reached, thereby fostering trust and reliability in the Sydney ecosystem. Network quality directly affects GGXT token value.\n\nParticipation workflow and requirements \nTo participate in The Golden Gate Sydney validator programme you need to do the following:\n\nContact GGX Team to acquire permission and GGXT tokens\nSet-up a Validator node following the instruction. \nStake tokens.\nMaintain your node. Link to maintenance guide. Clauses and penalties for bad maintenance\n\n"},"sydney-testnet/sydney-bug-bounty-programme.html":{"url":"sydney-testnet/sydney-bug-bounty-programme.html","title":"Sydney Bug Bounty Program","keywords":"","body":"Sydney Bug Bounty Program\nThe Sydney bug bounty program is an initiative by the Golden Gate team to engage web3 developers and enthusiasts in securing the Golden Gate network for a reward in GGXT tokens.\nThe scope of the program is the Golden Gate Sydney testnet. \nHow to Apply\nTo apply for our bug bounty program, contact us at info@ggxchain.io specifying \"Bug Bounty\" in the subject.
