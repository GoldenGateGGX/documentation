# Golden Gate Grants Program

The Golden Gate grant program is a fund aimed at supporting projects valuable for the Golden Gate ecosystem.

The grant program focuses on the following topics:

* Interface for tokens that support psp22 and ERC-20 standards simultaneously&#x20;
* Interface for tokens that support psp34 and ERC-721 standards simultaneously&#x20;
* Interface for tokens that support psp1155 and ERC-1155 standards simultaneously
* Financial instruments to hedge risks specific to DeFi (high amount of tokens of big volatility)
* Implementations of communication standards
* Applications that require both WASM and EVM&#x20;
* Ecosystem development (e.g. gas costs optimization)
* Security enhancements (watchdogs, optimistic oracles)

Submitted grants should be split into milestones with the size of 1-3 months of development. Every milestone will be reviewed by our team.

Security audit is required.
